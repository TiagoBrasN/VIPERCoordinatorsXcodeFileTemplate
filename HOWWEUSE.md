## üìñ Project architecture

Most of Nodes APPs was architectured using üêç Viper Architecture.
Architecture templates can be found [HERE!](https://github.com/nodes-ios/VIPERCoordinatorsXcodeFileTemplate)


### Project structure

The project consists in a 5 layer architecture.

- Coordinator:
	- Contains the navigation logic flow and holds the reference of the views to persent.
- Interactor:
	- Where all the business logic goes specific by each use case.
- Presenter:
	- It's a bridge between the Interactor and the View Controller. 
	- It's their responsability to prepare the data for display.
- ViewController:
	- Displays the content and handles the UI events to the presenter.
- Models:
	- Provides the model for the interactor.
	- It's used to share the data between the layers.


Each layer has it's own accessors from outside. We call it `input` and `output`.

To interact with `input's` and `output's` we use protocols. It means that the objects will be stricted to the actions described in the protocols bringing more reliability and type safe to our project.

--

**The coordinator** (or Router) is responsable to instantiate and initilize the views during the app lifecicle when needed.
One coordinator takes care of one or more scenes. It means that we don't have to create one coordinator for each scene.
We can have one coordinator taking care of the same group of views.

Eg.: Profile create, profile edit and profile display.

--

**Interactor** holds the business logic of a specific scene. It has the connection with the Models to manipulate the data. It should be totaly independent from the UI.

One of it's responsabilities is to make the API call's and parse the received data to the models.
All the data is provided throght the input's and output's.

--

**Presenter** is responsable to handle the view interactions and drive the UI. It receives all the user actions on the UI and drives the app to the correct path. It's also their responsability to make the calls for the other layers in order to get the data or to navigate to another flow. It also has it's accessors defined by the input and output protocols.

--

**View Controller** manages the interface for the user. The view never asks the presenter for data. It's passive and wait until the presenter gives the data back to be presented in the view. All the events should be send to the presenter. When the data is ready, the presenter will invoke the output method from the view controller with the result of the request.

--

**Models** It's not just data structures. We use the models to share the data between the different layers of the scene.

Eg.: The interactor makes a API call and receive the json file. The data will be parsed and stored in memory in the models and it can be accessed on presenter layer.


## Flow control

## Protocols

In order to notificate the objects through the app, we use protocols.
Be carfull when define your protocols to avoid retain cycles. Make your protocols conform to `class` protocol to its declaration and use `weak` reference when declaring your variables.

Eg.: 

```
protocol MyCoordinatorInput: class { }
weak var coordinator: MyCoordinatorInput?
```

## Testing

Using Viper architecture, everything is easy to test since it's proposal is based on SRP (Single Responsibility Principle).

For automated tests, we suggest you to use Quick and Nimble framework.
